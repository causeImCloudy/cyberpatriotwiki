Each module contains a lot of different security settings, each very important to completely securing a system. Be sure to write your checklist/strategy that covers everything so you don't miss out on important points.

At the beginning, remember to launch the image, choose "I Copied It", register with CP using your Unique ID, and you are in a Work environment (if requested). Then Read the README and any Scored Questions.

Here are the topics you should make sure are on your list. Make sure you plan when to do what, as some items take longer, and some items can disable others. Also, there may be some points on your list that can give you a penalty if the instructions in the README say different. Make sure your list can change if the competition requires it.

Account Lockout Policies
Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware
Audit Policies
Firewall
Group Permissions
Password Policies
Programs
Remote Access
Security Settings
Services
Shared Folders
Update/Service Packs
User Accounts
Once you have secured all of the required items within each of those categories, start looking at the running processes and open network ports.

We have found typing in commands on a keyboard can be way more efficient and powerful. A lot of the items in the course relies on commands typed into a "Run window". "Run" can be opened by holding down the Windows key on your keyboard and pressing the R key. In this window, you can type the file name of any program loaded within the Windows directory. This can be expanded to allow more programs, however that is outside of the realm of this course.

For example, to open the Computer Management window, you could type in compmgmt.msc instead of having to find the Computer Management link from where you are at. Saves a lot of time
