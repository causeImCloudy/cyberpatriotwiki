## Overview

First lets start with an overview of the curriculum and this wiki. This curriculm is based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Hardening Standards, and the years of experience of competing and even winning Nationals. 

To get started this page will show you the very basics of setting up a Virtual Machine, setting-up an image, and logging in. Then we will walk through what to expect on compeition, and provide some stradegies for being sucessful on compeition day.

### The Basics
The next section in the Curriculm category is [**The Basics**](/curriculum/basics) this will take you through the very basics of hardening both Linux, and Windows operating systems (OS). This section can be practiced by running through the Beginner images in the practice section.  The topic for each will include:
- Cyber Security Basics
- Technical Definitions
- User and Group Management
- OS Application Management
- OS Policies and Services
- Firewalls
</br>
</br>

### Advanced Concepts
The [Advanced Concepts](/curriculum/advanced) section will take you through more advanced topics that are not always black and white; they will require you to do more research and use critical thinking to find and fix them.
The topics you will learn and the research you will do, will bring you closer to understanding OS internals and keeping computers secure from advance threats. Due to the vast difference in how Linux and Windows build their core systems the topics for this section will vary for each operating system, rest assure both are covered with lots of detail. Some general topics include:
- Securing Applications
- Incident Response Techniques
- Strategy Building
- Active Directory
- Mail Servers
</br>
</br>

### Other Topics
This section, [Other Topics](/curriculum/other),  covers a vast array of topics that either pertain to general skills in Cyber Security or are specific to the CyberPatriot competition and do not fit well into the other categories. These topics can be quite advanced and range in difficulty, many of which are optional to learn. Each topic will introduce the topic, provide basic knowledge, and then cover advanced usage. The Topics in this section will continue to change as the CyberPatriot competition changes, and as we get requests for topics from Students.
- Computer Forensics
- Scripting/Programming
- Web Application Testing
- Cisco Networking
- Boeing Challenge
- Stradegy Building
