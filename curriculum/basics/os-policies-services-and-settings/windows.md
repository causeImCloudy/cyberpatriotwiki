# Windows Features and Control Panel
Windows Features and the Control Panel are essential tools within the Microsoft Windows operating system designed to allow users to customize, configure, and manage their computing environment. The Control Panel provides a centralized interface where users can adjust system settings, manage hardware, and modify various options related to appearance, security, and functionality. Within the Control Panel lies the "Windows Features" option, which enables users to add or remove specific components and capabilities of the Windows OS, tailoring their system to fit their needs and preferences. Together, these tools empower users to personalize and optimize their Windows experience.

# Group Policy
Group Policy is a function in Windows which helps control what features are accessible to the user. There are a variety of options which we should set in general for security, but there may also be some specific Group Policy Objects (GPO) that need to be set for items specified in the Read Me. Cyber Patriot is also known to mess with GPOs to make your job much harder.

# Windows Services 
Windows services are specialized applications that run in the background of the Windows operating system. These services are designed to provide specific functionalities or support certain system tasks without requiring user intervention. They can start automatically during system boot, or they can be manually initiated, depending on their configuration. Essential for system operations, network communications, and other core processes, Windows services are managed through the "Services" application, where users can start, stop, or configure service behaviors.

# Windows Registry
The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the Microsoft Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry for configuration. It contains information, settings, and options for both the OS and installed applications, enabling users to customize their environment and developers to configure their apps. Comprised of keys and values, akin to folders and files, the registry is integral to the system's functionality and stability. Unauthorized or incorrect edits can lead to system malfunctions, making backup and caution crucial when making direct changes.

# Windows Event Log
The Windows Event Log is a built-in tool in the Windows operating system that records detailed information about significant system occurrences, such as system warnings, errors, and informational events. This logging mechanism provides administrators and advanced users insights into the operations of the system, helping in troubleshooting, system monitoring, and audit trails. Entries in the event log, termed as "events," are sourced from both Windows components and installed applications, making it a centralized repository for understanding the health and activities of a computer system.

# Miscellaneous Windows Configuration Files
Outside the above policies and configuration options, Windows also has a variety of files and databases located around the operating system that also help in the day-to-day operations of the OS. Some of these are options which can help you with forensic questions, others are configurations options you will need to check every round.
