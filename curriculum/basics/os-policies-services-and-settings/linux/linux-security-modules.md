# Introduction 

Linux Security Module (LSM) is a framework that allows kernel security modules to be loaded into the Linux kernel to provide additional security functionality. LSM can be used to enhance the security posture of your Ubuntu 20.04 system by implementing various security policies and access controls.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing and configuring LSM on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Update Your System

Before installing LSM, it's a good practice to update your system's package repositories and upgrade installed packages to the latest versions:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install LSM Framework

Ubuntu 20.04 includes support for LSM, and you can install the necessary packages with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install apparmor-utils
```

### Step 3: Enable and Configure LSM

By default, AppArmor is the LSM framework that Ubuntu uses. You can enable and configure AppArmor to enhance your system's security:

#### Enable AppArmor

```bash
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
```

#### Check AppArmor Status

```bash
sudo aa-status
```

#### Configure AppArmor Profiles

AppArmor profiles define access control policies for specific applications. You can create and manage AppArmor profiles to restrict an application's access to system resources. Refer to the AppArmor documentation for details on creating and managing profiles.

## Conclusion

LSM, specifically AppArmor, provides an additional layer of security for your Ubuntu 20.04 system by allowing you to define access control policies and enhance security. By following the installation and configuration steps outlined in this guide, you can leverage LSM to better protect your system.

Remember to consult the documentation of your chosen LSM framework for more advanced configuration options and security best practices.
