Microsoft can release important security updates and bug fixes though their Microsoft or Windows Update feature built into Windows. Since updates can be released at anytime, it is best to have them installed as soon as possible.


## Update Windows

1. Search `Windows Update Settings` in the Windows search bar.
2. Click the option `Check for Updates`.
3. Click the `Download and install`.
4. If required click `Restart now` once installed.

Continue to do this until it says there are no updates available, then check again just to be sure.
