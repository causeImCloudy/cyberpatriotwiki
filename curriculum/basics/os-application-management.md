# Introduction

This section will guide you through each of the topics for installing, uninstalling, and managing programs on both Linux and Windows.



# Installing Programs
Using an operating system with just the basic functionality provided is not going to be very effective. Luckily we can install additional software that expands on the OS and help perform tasks.

# Uninstalling Programs
Sometimes those programs you install are no longer needed, and sometimes those programs are malicious or should not be on your system. You will need to know how to remove programs from the file system, and the operating system install location.

# Update Programs
When you have a program on your system it is good practice to maintain and update the program to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.
