# Introduction

Policies and Services are the underlying configurations that keep the operating system and all its features running. Both Linux and Windows have a variety of different names for these which will go into more detail on each page. 

To fully understand how policies and services work we will need to dive into there function specific to each operating system.

# Windows

Windows policies and services form integral components of the Windows operating system, governing user privileges, system operations, and various functionalities. Policies, often managed through Group Policy, allow administrators to control settings across computers and users in an Active Directory environment, ensuring security and operational consistency. Services, on the other hand, are background processes that run to support or provide Windows features, such as updates or networking. Proper management and understanding of these tools ensure a smooth and secure Windows operating environment.

# Linux

Linux policies and services are foundational elements of the Linux ecosystem, defining user permissions and system tasks. Policies, typically managed via tools like SELinux or AppArmor, set strict controls over processes and user interactions to bolster security. Services, run through system managers like systemd or init, are background processes essential for various system functionalities. Together, they facilitate a robust and stable Linux operating environment.
