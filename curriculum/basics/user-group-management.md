# Introduction

This section will guide you through each of the topics for securing the local user database and controlling with groups and permissions each user has.



# User Management
Unsecured user accounts are the largest vulnerability currently in the Cyber Security field. Since there will always be Human Error, there is almost no way to fix this vulnerability, however, we can setup permissions, settings, and policies to mitigate some of the potential exploitable accounts. For this section, we will be working on the Permissions and Settings.

# Group Management
A Group refers to a collection of users who share the same access rights or attribute to specific systems within an organization.

The purpose of creating groups is to simplify the management of permissions and attributes. Instead of assigning permissions to each individual user, an administrator can assign permissions to a group, and then add users to that group. Any user who is part of a group will automatically inherit the access rights and permissions assigned to that group.

This concept is crucial in large organizations where hundreds or thousands of users might need to be managed. By utilizing groups, an organization can ensure that users only have access to the resources they need, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving overall security.
