# Introduction

As a part of cybersecurity there are other actions which do not directly enhance the security of a system, but are considered to be Business Best Practice. Implementing these practices helps in creating a robust cybersecurity framework that not only protects a business's digital assets but also enhances its credibility and trust with customers and stakeholders. Each business defines what is best practice for them, some companies require social media sites to be blocked while for others its imperative to the services they offer.

## Prohibited Files

Prohibited files in a business context refer to any type of digital content that is not permitted within the company's network due to security, legal, or ethical reasons. These often include files containing malicious software, pirated software or media, inappropriate or offensive content, and confidential data from external sources without proper authorization. The restriction of such files is crucial to maintain cybersecurity, comply with legal and regulatory standards, and uphold the company's ethical and professional standards.

# Linux

Linux policies and services are foundational elements of the Linux ecosystem, defining user permissions and system tasks. Policies, typically managed via tools like SELinux or AppArmor, set strict controls over processes and user interactions to bolster security. Services, run through system managers like systemd or init, are background processes essential for various system functionalities. Together, they facilitate a robust and stable Linux operating environment.

> For the sake of this wiki we will focus on Ubuntu, but each Linux flavor has similar concepts covered by different programs.
