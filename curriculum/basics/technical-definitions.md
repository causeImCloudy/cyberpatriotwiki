## Definitions

Cybersecurity has its own language, filled with acronyms and terms. This glossary offers a list of some of the most commonly used acronyms in the field of cybersecurity along with their definitions.

This page serves as a basic intro, there are many more terms to know. If you can not find a term here your best bet is google.

1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** - A widely used symmetric encryption standard that provides high-level data security.

2. **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** - A stealthy and continuous computer hacking process, often orchestrated by criminals targeting a specific entity.

3. **AV (Antivirus)** - Software designed to detect and destroy computer viruses and other malicious software.

4. **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)** - A policy allowing employees to bring personally owned devices to their workplace, and to use those devices to access privileged company information and applications.

5. **CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)** - A model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

6. **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)** - The executive responsible for an organization's information and data security.

7. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** - An attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.

8. **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** - An attack intended to cripple a network's services by flooding it with excessive requests at the same time.

9. **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** - A physical or logical subnetwork that exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually the internet.

10. **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)** - A strategy for ensuring that end users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.

11. **DNS (Domain Name System)** - The system that translates internet domain names into IP addresses.

12. **DoS (Denial of Service)** - An attack aimed at making a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

13. **E2EE (End-to-End Encryption)** - A system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages, preventing intermediaries from accessing the cryptographic keys needed to decrypt the conversation.

14. **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** - A framework of policies and technologies ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources.

15. **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** - A device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.

16. **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** - A system that monitors a network for any malicious activities such as security threats or policy violations and attempts to prevent them.

17. **ISMS (Information Security Management System)** - A systematic approach for managing sensitive company information to ensure it remains secure.

18. **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** - An international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.

19. **IV (Initialization Vector)** - A random or pseudo-random number used in combination with a secret key for data encryption.

20. **MDM (Mobile Device Management)** - Software that allows IT administrators to control, secure, and enforce policies on smartphones, tablets, and other endpoints.

21. **NAC (Network Access Control)** - An approach to computer security that attempts to unify endpoint security technology, user or system authentication, and network security enforcement.

22. **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)** - A physical sciences laboratory and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce, which develops technology, metrics, and standards to drive innovation and improve security.

23. **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** - Information collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context.

24. **OTP (One-Time Password)** - A password that is valid for only one login session or transaction.

25. **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)** - A distributed architecture that partitions tasks or workloads among peers, who are equally privileged participants in the application.

26. **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** - A framework for services that create, distribute, and manage digital certificates, used to facilitate secure electronic transfer of information.

27. **RAT (Remote Access Trojan)** - A malware program that includes a back door for administrative control over the target computer.

28. **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** - A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which allows a user to connect to another computer over a network connection in a much smoother manner.

29. **RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman)** - An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

30. **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** - Tools and services offering a holistic view of an organizationâ€™s information security.

31. **SOC (Security Operations Center)** - A facility where an IT team manages security issues on an organizational and technical level.

32. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** - The standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding sensitive data.

33. **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** - A protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the internet.

34. **TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)** - The behavior of an adversary, such as a cyberattacker or an intruder.

35. **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)** - Cybersecurity process about detection of insider threats, targeted attacks, and financial fraud.

36. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** - A technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.

37. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** - A type of injection security attack in which an attacker injects data, such as a malicious script, into content from otherwise trusted websites.

38. **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** - A method of confirming users' claimed identities by using a combination of two different factors.

39. **3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)** - A type of computerized cryptography where block cipher algorithms are applied three times to each data block.

40. **3PAO (Third Party Assessment Organizations)** - Organizations that perform assessments of cloud systems to provide evidence and validation that a set of agreed-upon standards are being adhered to.
