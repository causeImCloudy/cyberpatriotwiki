## Module 1: What is Cybersecurity

<br>

### Definition

Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. 

<br>

### Why is Cyber Security Important

In an era where almost every aspect of our daily life relies heavily on technology, from communication tools like email, smartphones, and tablets, to transportation navigation systems, online shopping, entertainment such as interactive video games, and social media apps, the importance of cybersecurity can't be overstated. The medical field is no exception, with medical equipment operation and medical records storage increasingly dependent on technology.

These advancements underscore the vast amounts of personal and sensitive data stored on both personal devices like computers, smartphones, tablets, and third-party systems.

### What happens when you have bad Cyber Security?

There are many risks, some more serious than others. Among these dangers are malware erasing your entire system, an attacker breaking into your system and altering files, an attacker using your computer to attack others, or an attacker stealing your credit card information and making unauthorized purchases. There is no guarantee that even with the best precautions some of these things won't happen to you, but there are steps you can take to minimize the chances.

### Who is Hiring? 
Nearly every organization needs cybersecurity professionals, and most company's are required to spend a large percentage of thier budget on Cyber Security.

Cybersecurity jobs are better paid that computer jobs in general. In 2018 the average computer job paid ~$90,000. People in cybersecurity-specific jobs earned an average salary of over $100,000.

## Module 2: Foundations to Cybersecurity

<br>

### CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a framework used in cybersecurity to help us understand the main objectives of keeping our digital information safe. It stands for:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access sensitive data.
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data, preventing unauthorized changes.
3. **Availability**: Making sure that authorized users have access to the data and resources when they need them.

> The CIA triad is an important concept which is the core of Cyber Security.

### IAAA (Triple A)

Triple A is the other major pillar of Cyber Security. The I is sometime left off of this acryonm. This acryonm deals with user management, as detailed below:

1. **Identity**: The process of a user claiming or professing an identity. This is usually done through a unique identifier, like a username or an email address.
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. This is usually done through a username, password combo.
3. **Authorization**: The process of granting or denying access rights to a user, program, or process. Once a user has been authenticated, the authorization process determines what permissions or activities are allowed for that user. These permissions can control access to data, software, functions, or other resources.
4. **Accountability**: The ability to link activities and changes back to their initiator through logging and auditing. Accountability ensures that all actions performed on a system can be attributed to an authenticated entity, providing traceability and non-repudiation.

<br>

### Threat Actors

Threat actors are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems or networks. They can be classified as:

1. **Hackers**: Individuals who break into computer systems, often for malicious purposes or personal gain.
2. **Cybercriminals**: Criminals who use the internet and computer technology to commit illegal activities.
3. **Nation-states**: Governments that engage in cyber espionage or cyber warfare to gather intelligence or attack other nations.
4. **Insiders**: Employees or individuals with authorized access who misuse their privileges to compromise a system or network.

### Risk

Risk, in terms of CyberSecurity, refers to the potential for loss or harm related to technical infrastructure, use of technology, or reputation due to a failure of information security measures. It encompasses the probability of a cyber threat exploiting vulnerabilities in a system, network, or application, and the potential impact or damage it could cause. The impact could result in financial losses, disruption of operations, theft of sensitive data, damage to the organization's reputation, or legal implications due to non-compliance with data protection laws and regulations.

Cybersecurity risk management is a key aspect of an organization's risk management strategy, aiming to minimize risks through the proper implementation of security controls and measures, regular security assessments and audits, employee training, and incident response planning.

Risk management is what drives the Cyber Security program at every company. Risk is what the business understands, and is the langauge of upper management.

## Module 3: Cyber Threats and Techniques

<br>

### Common Attack Techniques

Here are some common attack techniques used by threat actors:

1. **Phishing**: A deceptive technique where attackers send fraudulent emails or messages, pretending to be from a trustworthy source, to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information or downloading malicious software.
2. **Malware**: Malicious software designed to compromise or damage a computer system or network, such as viruses, worms, or ransomware.
3. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attack that overwhelms a computer system or network with traffic or requests, making it unable to respond to legitimate users.
4. **Brute Force**: An attack in which the attacker attempts to guess a user's password or encryption key by trying every possible combination until the correct one is found.
