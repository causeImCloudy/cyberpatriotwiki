# Introduction
**Scripts** are a popular topic for CyberPatriot which in the past we have largely left to the individual teams to discover and create. This section will give you enough information about programming to automate basic tasks in CyberPatriot and direct you further advance your programming skill. This section will only include boilerplate code, as it is against the CyberPatriot rules to provide scripts or other programs to teams. 
> IT IS AGAINST CYBERPATRIOT RULES TO SHARE YOUR SCRIPTS WITH NON-TEAM MEMBERS EVEN AFTER THE COMPETITION

At its core, programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to perform tasks. Think of a computer as a very obedient chef who needs exact step-by-step recipes to make dishes. In this analogy, programming is the act of writing these recipes. Just like we have different languages to communicate with each other, computers have their own languages for programming. Some popular ones are Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. The choice of language often depends on what you're trying to achieve. For instance, if you're making a website, you might choose JavaScript. If you're working with data analysis, Python is often a favorite.

Scripting is a type of programming that automates a series of tasks in a computer. Scripts are often shorter and more task-specific than full-fledged software applications. While not always true, scripts typically refer to the use of bash or powershell. For these you simply write a text file as though you are typing in the command line, but you have ac
> For the sake of this wiki we will focus on utilizing Python as it can be compatible cross OS. We will touch on bash and powershell scripting slightly.

# Programming
While there are endless resources available on the internet much better at teaching programming, this section serve as a crash course in programming that focuses on the applicability to the CyberPatriot competition. It is strongly recommend to go through this section in order but if you already have an understanding feel free to skip forward past the introduction sections.
