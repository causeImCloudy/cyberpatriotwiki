# Installing an Integrated Development Environment
While you can very easily program in a simple text editor, there are new platforms that provide many useful features. Everybody's IDE is different and subject to personal preference. For this wiki we will us VSCode because it is free and widely supported. An IDE is only one part in a developers workflow, but most likely the one they will spend the most time in.

## Virtual Studio Code
1. Open `https://code.visualstudio.com` in a web browser.
2. Click `Download` on the latest vscode build.
3. Locate the installer file, and install it.
4. Accept any prompts and proceed with a default installation
